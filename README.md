### Role of each member
##### Hari
For this project, I was in charge of the following:
-Predator-Prey Model backend
-State interface and State Enums for each simulation
-Loader package (Loader.java, XMLCreator.java, XMLException.javaj, XMLParse.java), and all configuration features
-Exception handling and alerts
-Refactoring code into the Model.java superclass and its subclasses
-Removing magic values from code and moving them to Resources.java 
As the project progressed, we all ended up helping each other out on practically every facet of the project so I also had a role working on other parts of the project including the Segregation model, the main package (specifically Controller.java), and other parts as well. Also, we all spent a lot of time refactoring and debugging each other's code.

##### Bihan
1) Designed the class hierarchy following the MVC model. Refactored so that the Controller, Views and Models integrate well together. Also refactored to better
separate frontend and backend. Worked on some GUI, View, Controller and Model methods. 

2) Designed and wrote classes in the cellshapeview and neighborfinder packages to allow different shapes of cells. 

3) Wrote backend for Segregation Cells.
