**Compsci 308: CellSociety DESIGN**
========================
INTRODUCTION
--------------
The primary goal of this project is to design a program that can run several pre-defined cellular automata models. The user will be able to specify the initial states and parameters of the models. The project will be designed such that it will be simple to add new types of models (rules, agents, number of neighbors, and states). The algorithms based on the rules specified for each model will be closed, but the parameters and initial states will be open for the user to set.
